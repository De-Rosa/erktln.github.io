        <h1>The Impacts of Computing on Education</h1>
        <p>Computing has changed education in many ways. The list below contains some of the positive impacts of computing on education</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Information sharing platforms</li>
            <li>Greater access to information</li>
            <li>Ease of communication</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Information sharing platforms</h2>
        <p>There are many services designed to allow students to view their assignments, feedback from their teachers and information about their courses. One of these services is <a href = "https://www.anthology.com/learn-ultra">Blackboard Learn Ultra</a>, which we use at Durham university. 
        These services help students to keep organised and manage their workloads</p>
        <h2>Greater access to information</h2>
        <p>The internet contains many informational websites. Students can use these to solidify their understanding of the topics they are being taught,
            or introduce themselves to entirely new topics. Some of these websites are used in lessons to provide students with activities to complete, such as <a href="https://projecteuler.net/">Project Euler</a>.
        </p>
        <h2>Ease of communication</h2>
        <p>Computers allow students to communicate with their teachers whithout having to be in the same building. Students who are struggling with a piece of work do not have to wait until the next time they will see their teacher to ask for assistance.
