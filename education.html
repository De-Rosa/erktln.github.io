                <p>Computing has changed education in many ways. The list below contains some of the positive impacts of computing on education</p>

                <h2 class="display-7">Information sharing platforms</h2>
                <p>There are many services designed to allow students to view their assignments, feedback from their teachers and information about their courses. One of these services is <a href = "https://www.anthology.com/learn-ultra">Blackboard Learn Ultra</a>, which we use at Durham University. 
                These services help students to keep organised and manage their workloads. These platforms were integral to education during the pandemic, allowing students to continue to access lessons from home.</p>
                <h2>Greater access to information</h2>
                <p>The internet contains many informational websites on a variety of topics. Students can use these to solidify their understanding of the topics they are being taught,
                or introduce themselves to entirely new topics, expanding their horizons beyond what their school or college offers. Some of these websites are used in lessons to provide students with activities to complete, such as <a href="https://projecteuler.net/">Project Euler</a>.
                </p>
                <h2 class="display-7">Ease of communication</h2>
                <p>Computers allow students to communicate with their teachers whithout having to be in the same building. Students who are struggling with a piece of work do not have to wait until the next time they will see their teacher to ask for assistance.
                Students can therefore overcome issues they are having before their next lesson, saving lesson time.
                </p>
                <p>
                Students can also easily communicate with other students in their class over the internet. Students can therefore ask each other for advice if they are struggling with a topic,
                and collaborate easily on group prjects without having all be available at the same time to meet face to face.
