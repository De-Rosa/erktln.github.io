          <h2 class="display-7">Introduction</h2>
          <p>"The most emerging tool in the research process is the computer" <a href="#sources">(1)</a>. This statement is echoed by the widespread use of computer algorithms in academia. These can range from pure number-crunching to complex analysis. There are many examples of computing in the sciences. For example, phycisist might need to know how to create a simulation, while a mathematician might need to compute large equations. Many undergraduate science degrees even require some module in the basics of designing computer algorithms for this purpose.</p>

        <div id="data">
          <h2 class="display-7">Data Processing</h2>
          <p>Computers can process large amounts of data with incredible speed compared to the average person.<br>This creates improvements in productivity and can open opportunities in analysing data that might have seemed impossible before. Sometimes, this can even lead to disproving theorems (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%27s_sum_of_powers_conjecture">Euler's sum of powers conjecture</a>).</p> 
        </div>
        <div id="litreview">
          <h2 class="display-7">Literature Review</h2>
          <p>Computers can store records of journals and other scientific documents which can be used for a more optimal search of past literature or, alternatively, compare a finalised document to both detect and prevent plagiarism.</p> 
        </div>
        <div id="datastorage">
          <h2 class="display-7">Data Storage</h2>
          <p>Computers can also be used to store large databases in a more compact and accessible form than a non-virtual counterpart like books. The World Wide Web enables sharing this data accross institutions and country borders, simplifying collaboration</p> 
        </div>
        <div id="communication">
          <h2 class="display-7">Communication</h2>
          <p>Computer-based communication is not restricted to data. Here are some examples:
            <ul>
              <li>Social media can be used to share research with the world, especially less scientific communities.</li>
              <li>Video calling brings the possibility of live collaboration, regardless of location. This means both an increase in remote jobs and international cooperation.</li>
              <li>Even ignoring these, simple messaging software has numerous implications for productivity.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
