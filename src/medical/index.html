        <p>Machine learning paradigms allow for many life-saving applications in medicine. Here are some examples:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Computer vision has been used to better diagnose symptoms from visual sources, such as radiographs and petri dishes

              <li>An example of this is the <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010482522004280#:~:text=It%20has%20the%20ability%20to,of%20cancer%20detection%20and%20therapy">detection of cancerous cells</a></li>

        <h2>Medical Image Computing (MIC)</h2>
        <p>MIC is one field where computing has made a hugely positive contribution to the world. In the past, medical imaging was very limited in scope due to x-ray technology without computers only capable of 2D images. But through the power of computing, scans can now create 3D representations of the inside of someone's body allowing to carefully examine every miniscule detail and potentially find problems earlier and more accurately.</p>
